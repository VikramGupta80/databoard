# FlutBoard

A news reader application that allows you to navigate news by flipping pages. You can select the news sources available in newsapi.org.

The application is a basic reimplementation of FlipBoard using Flutter.

Try it by downloading it from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chemamolins.flutboard).

# Configuration

Request an API KEY in https://newsapi.org

Set the key in "keys.dart" file.

### Release only:

Since the build.gradle is now configured to sign the release apk using a production certificate, you need to add a keys.properties file as explained in [flutter.io](https://flutter.io/android-release/).
